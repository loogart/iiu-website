                            <h3>Chair and Co-Founder, Open Source Pharma Foundation</h3>

                            <p>An international human rights lawyer, scholar and social entrepreneur, Jaykumar Menon is currently a Research Fellow at the Centre for International Sustainable Development Law, which is based at McGill University in Canada. He fancies himself a giant killer, and a collector of impossible tasks. His research, teachings and practice focus on innovation and human rights. He seeks to use open innovation techniques such as crowdsourcing and open intellectual property to help realize basic human rights for a billion people. He is a founder of the Open Source Pharma Foundation, which aims to help generate affordable new medicines in areas of great health need. OSPF currently in late stage clinical trials for a new therapy for tuberculosis. The TB bacteria inhabits ¼ of humanity. He is also a founder of The India Nutrition Initiative, which is developing salt double-fortified with iron and iodine (“DFS”), to help address the world’s the most widespread form of malnutrition, iron deficiency, which afflicts 2 billion people. DFS is currently reaching over 20 million people daily.</p>

                            <p>His innovation-for-humanity concepts have recently received over $111 million in funding from groups such as the Gates Foundation, Tata Trusts, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Open Society Foundations, and governments in Canada and India. Previously, he led the international development and education programs at the X PRIZE Foundation, a radical innovation group funded by the founders of Google and Facebook that awards $10+ million incentive prizes to teams that achieve targeted “radical breakthroughs for the benefit of humanity”. He founded X PRIZE’s operations in India and has worked on innovation and development with WFP, IIT-Delhi, the UN Secretary-General’s Office, the Prime Minister’s Office of the Government of India, and other groups. He also worked as a strategy consultant at McKinsey. </p>

                            <p>As a human rights lawyer at the New York City-based Center for Constitutional Rights and working alongside activists and community groups, he won a string of victories in high profile cases. He represented the student leaders of Tiananmen Square against the ex-Premier of China, and helped win a $4 billion judgment on behalf of victims of the Bosnian genocide against Radovan Karadzic. He helped represent the family of Nigerian environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in a landmark corporations and human rights suit against Royal Dutch Shell ($15M settlement) and freed a man from death row in Indiana. As the fifteenth lawyer to take up the case, he hunted through the prisons of New York for the real killer and helped exonerate a man named David Wong who has served over a decade of a life sentence for murder. </p>

                            <p>As a scholar, he has written articles in top peer-reviewed international human rights law reference journals and books, including those published by the Oxford University Press. As an entrepreneur, he has co-founded a venture-funded Internet company that currently has seven-figure revenues. He is a published creative writer and has written a short story in an anthology that collectively won the American Book Award. He received the William Rogers Award in 2016, the Brown Alumni Association’s highest honor, given to one person annually for a life of “usefulness and reputation”; prior winners include diplomat Richard Holbrooke, the current World Bank president, a vice chair of Citibank, and an astronaut.</p>

                            <p>Jaykumar holds a JD and a Master of International Affairs from Columbia University along with a BA degree and one year of medical school at Brown University. Through his creative and strategic approach, he hopes to bring about a just and large-scale social change in the communities he works with.

                            <h3>President &amp; Chief Executive Officer Vancity</h3>
                            <p>As president and chief executive officer of Vancity, Canada's largest community credit union, Tamara Vrooman believes that banking has a vital role in developing a healthy society—building the well-being of people and, at the same time, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the communities in which they live and work. This summarizes Vancity's vision of redefining wealth.</p>

                            <p>Tamara views the economy as much more than what is written on a balance sheet; it includes the social and natural economies in which we all live. Understanding the interdependence of these three means that Vancity takes a very different approach to banking, ensuring its products, services and advice deliver financial, social and environmental results for the more than 523,000 members it serves. </p>

                            <p>As a member-owned financial co-operative, Vancity is ideally suited to operate in an economy that is ever changing because it is through its close connection with members that Vancity sees what is required to meet their changing needs. This 'member-led innovation' guides Vancity in its business strategies to use the $25.6 billion in members' assets and assets under administration it holds to create community impact.</p>

                            <p>Under Tamara's leadership, Vancity has gained international recognition for its values-based banking model. Vancity was the first Canadian financial institution invited to join the Global Alliance for Banking on Values, an independent network of the world's leading sustainable banks and banking co-operatives. Tamara's voice is also sought internationally—she has been invited by Pope Francis, the Dalai Lama, as well as other government and business leaders to share Vancity's business model at various summits and conferences.</p>

                            <p>Tamara's achievements include leading Vancity to become the first carbon-neutral financial institution in North America, to become the largest private-sector living wage employer in Canada, and to tackle the shadow financial system by launching an alternative to predatory payday loans for its members—the Vancity Fair &amp; Fast Loan™. Vancity was named Canada's Best Corporate Citizen in both 2016 and 2017 by Corporate Knights, and has also received many national and international awards for its business leadership.</p>

                            <p>All of this was achieved while growing the assets plus assets under administration of the credit union 61 per cent to $25.6 billion and achieving the highest profits in the organization's 70-year history. Under Tamara's direction, more than one-fifth, or $5.4 billion, of Vancity's assets plus assets under administration are invested in impact.</p>

                            <p>Prior to joining Vancity, Tamara served as Deputy Minister of Finance for the Province of British Columbia and as Secretary to the Treasury Board and CEO of the Public Sector Employers' Council where she oversaw the government's annual $100 billion borrowing and cash requirements and developed its $36 billion fiscal plan. Her prior portfolio was as Deputy Minister and Executive Financial Officer for the Ministry of Health.</p>

                            <p>Tamara pursued post-secondary education at the University of Victoria, earning a Master of Arts in History in 1994 and a Bachelor of Arts with honours in 1991. She also received an Honorary Doctorate (Laws) from Simon Fraser University in 2016 and an Honorary Doctorate (Technology) from the British Columbia Institute of Technology in 2013.</p>

                            <p>On a personal level, Tamara lends her voice and leadership experience to issues related to women, families and children with a particular focus on issues related to equality, inclusion and empowerment.
