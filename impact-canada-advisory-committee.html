                            <h3>Chair and Co-Founder, Open Source Pharma Foundation</h3>

                            <p>An international human rights lawyer, scholar and social entrepreneur, Jaykumar Menon is currently a Research Fellow at the Centre for International Sustainable Development Law, which is based at McGill University in Canada. He fancies himself a giant killer, and a collector of impossible tasks. His research, teachings and practice focus on innovation and human rights. He seeks to use open innovation techniques such as crowdsourcing and open intellectual property to help realize basic human rights for a billion people. He is a founder of the Open Source Pharma Foundation, which aims to help generate affordable new medicines in areas of great health need. OSPF currently in late stage clinical trials for a new therapy for tuberculosis. The TB bacteria inhabits ¼ of humanity. He is also a founder of The India Nutrition Initiative, which is developing salt double-fortified with iron and iodine (“DFS”), to help address the world’s the most widespread form of malnutrition, iron deficiency, which afflicts 2 billion people. DFS is currently reaching over 20 million people daily.</p>

                            <p>His innovation-for-humanity concepts have recently received over $111 million in funding from groups such as the Gates Foundation, Tata Trusts, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Open Society Foundations, and governments in Canada and India. Previously, he led the international development and education programs at the X PRIZE Foundation, a radical innovation group funded by the founders of Google and Facebook that awards $10+ million incentive prizes to teams that achieve targeted “radical breakthroughs for the benefit of humanity”. He founded X PRIZE’s operations in India and has worked on innovation and development with WFP, IIT-Delhi, the UN Secretary-General’s Office, the Prime Minister’s Office of the Government of India, and other groups. He also worked as a strategy consultant at McKinsey. </p>

                            <p>As a human rights lawyer at the New York City-based Center for Constitutional Rights and working alongside activists and community groups, he won a string of victories in high profile cases. He represented the student leaders of Tiananmen Square against the ex-Premier of China, and helped win a $4 billion judgment on behalf of victims of the Bosnian genocide against Radovan Karadzic. He helped represent the family of Nigerian environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in a landmark corporations and human rights suit against Royal Dutch Shell ($15M settlement) and freed a man from death row in Indiana. As the fifteenth lawyer to take up the case, he hunted through the prisons of New York for the real killer and helped exonerate a man named David Wong who has served over a decade of a life sentence for murder. </p>

                            <p>As a scholar, he has written articles in top peer-reviewed international human rights law reference journals and books, including those published by the Oxford University Press. As an entrepreneur, he has co-founded a venture-funded Internet company that currently has seven-figure revenues. He is a published creative writer and has written a short story in an anthology that collectively won the American Book Award. He received the William Rogers Award in 2016, the Brown Alumni Association’s highest honor, given to one person annually for a life of “usefulness and reputation”; prior winners include diplomat Richard Holbrooke, the current World Bank president, a vice chair of Citibank, and an astronaut.</p>

                            <p>Jaykumar holds a JD and a Master of International Affairs from Columbia University along with a BA degree and one year of medical school at Brown University. Through his creative and strategic approach, he hopes to bring about a just and large-scale social change in the communities he works with.
